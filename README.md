# Hand Pose Training with TensorFlow.js and ml5.js

This project demonstrates a simple example of hand pose recognition using TensorFlow.js and ml5.js. The application utilizes TensorFlow's HandPose model to detect hand movements through the device's camera. Users can train the model to recognize open and closed hand poses using the KNN classifier algorithm from ml5.js.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/GarikHarutyunyan/js-hand-pose-training.git


2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Allow access to your device's camera when prompted.

4. Choose between the "Open Hand" and "Closed Hand" options to train the model by clicking on the respective buttons and performing the corresponding hand poses.

5. After training, click on the "Start Prediction" button to begin hand pose recognition.

6. Hold your hand in a pose, and the system will predict whether your hand is open or closed based on the trained model.
